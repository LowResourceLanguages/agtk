<p><b>Bigball AG wrappers and file I/O plugins</b></p>
<p>The bigball ag wrappers, which are built with the <a
href="install.html#--enable-bigball">--enable-bigball</a> option,
won't work with file I/O plugins. It's because there are two seperate
AG data spaces: one in the bigball wrapper modules, and the other one in
the library linked with the file I/O modules. Thus you can load annotation
files using the plugins, but you cannot access the loaded AGs through
the bigball wrappers, because the loaded AGs are in a different space.</p>
